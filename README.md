# The Waiting Game

Your goal as a player of The Waiting Game is to wait a random amount of time, somewhere between two to four seconds to click a button and a message will display whether you were too fast, too slow, or right on the target.

This project was implemented as a WPF App (.NET Framework) using Microsoft Visual Studio

I first wrote The Waiting Game as a C# file, you can find it in the folder waiting_game. I then turned it into a WPF App (.NET Framework), you can find it in the folder WaitingGame, to make it more interactive while having a visual to see pop up.
